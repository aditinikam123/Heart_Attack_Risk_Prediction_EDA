# 🫀 Heart Attack Risk Prediction (EDA)

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a heart disease dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations in health parameters that contribute to heart attack risks. It also includes a basic machine learning model for predicting risk levels.

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand relationships between features like age, cholesterol, heart rate, chest pain, etc.
- Visualize distributions, outliers, and correlations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Identify important features that influence heart attack risk
- Build a simple predictive model using Scikit-learn

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for prediction)

## 📁 Files
- `Heart_Attack_Risk_Prediction(EDA).ipynb` – Contains the full EDA workflow and prediction model
